                  Our event has a well-deserved reputation for quality and students support. However, faced with
                  changes in the known technology, we should seek new ideas that match these changes, and push
                  up the limitations that prevent taking full advantage of the new improvements in technology.

                    The arena is an architectural maquette for Aswan city, each team is asked to build one robot that will be controlled manually to shoot targets occupied by the other team, the more targets you shot the higher score you gain.
                    In the last stage of the war the robot have to shot the target automatically.

                    It’s a marvelous chance for students, particularly civil engineers. It helps them to apply
                    what they learn and use engineering design process to build a structure from spaghetti to handle
                    pressure.
